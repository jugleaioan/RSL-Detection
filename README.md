# RSL-Detection
Computer Vision Project

HOW TO USE

Run detect_gestures.py, you can change the model used in the code, different versions are better at recognizing different gestures.

Other scripts are used to prepare data and train/test the model, with the exception of detect_hand.py which was just a test.
